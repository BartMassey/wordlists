# Word Lists

These word lists are useful for puzzle solvers and the like.

* `freq-words.txt.gz`, `freq.txt.gz`: *Frequently Used Word
  List*__ This list of about 52,000 words is based on Peter
  Norvig's 300,000 word ngram frequency list, which was
  built from Google's *Web Trillion Word Corpus*; this list
  was filtered to include only dictionary words. Each word
  is accompanied in `freq.txt.gz` by its frequency of use in
  the Google corpus; `freq-words.txt.gz` contains only the
  words. The file [`README.freq.md`](README.freq.md) in this
  distribution contains copyright and license as well as
  other information, including a detailed description of
  list construction.

* `eowl.txt.gz`: *The English Open Word List (EOWL)*  
  This list is compiled by Ken Loge based on the UK Advanced
  Cryptics Dictionary by J. Ross Beresford. It is reasonably
  comprehensive. The file
  [`README.eowl.html`](README.eowl.html) in this
  distribution contains copyright and license as well as
  other information.

* `scowl.txt.gz`: *Spell Checker Oriented Word List (SCOWL)*  
  Kevin Atkinson compiled this list from a variety of
  sources. The list here is the "size 40 american" list.
  The file [`README.scowl.txt`](README.scowl.txt) in this
  distribution contains copyright and license as well as
  other information.

To use these lists, `gunzip` them. The result will have UNIX
line-endings (ASCII LF) which may need help on non-UNIX
boxes.

The official Scrabble&trade; SOWPODS list is not made
available here due to copyright concerns.
